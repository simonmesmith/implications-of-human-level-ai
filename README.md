# Implications of Human Level AI

The purpose of this repository is to experiment with creating an article on the implications of human-level AI by having AI and humans collaborate on the article.

Claude 3.5 Sonnet created the firstion version as follows:

## Initial Prompt:

> Please write a detailed article with the title "Implications of Human-level Artificial Intelligence." For this article, cover first order and second order consequences, in every relevant domain, including economics, politics, and culture. Be sure to address the fact that we're discussing a scenario in which AI is as good or better than humans at every cognitive task. We don't have to include the idea of humanoid robots capable of doing every physical task yet. Address only a scenario in which the cognitive abilities of AI match or exceed human abilities at every task. Robot bodies will follow, likely designed by the AIs themselves. Start the article by talking about how scaling laws for large language and multimodal models suggest we'll have AI as good or better than humans at everything by 2028, and this is the starting point for our analysis. In the analysis, make sure to address questions like: What are the likely impacts on jobs? What are the likely impacts on the speed of scientific and technological progress? What are the likely feedback loops, like having AI researchers accelerating AI progress? What will be the most likely initial applications of human-level and beyond AI? What about culture? How will people adapt? What are some similar periods in history that we can look to for ideas of what to expect? What will happen to meaning? How will education be affected? What might people find valuable to do with their time? What precedents can we look to? What books or TV shows or movie can help us navigate this?

## Follow-up Prompt:

> This is a great start.
> 
> Can we add a section on what might be scarce in this new world? For example, we'll still need energy to power AI, and chips to power AI. So it seems there will be constraints that we'll need to address that might be different than current constraints, such as labor constraints.
> 
> Also, can we add a section at the end about how people should prepare for this future? This should come before the conclusion. What should people be doing now? What are the smartest things for people to do now?

Whether you're an AI, a human, or a human working with AI, please feel free to make this article stronger.
